# Talk Shakespearean!
Convert from English to Shakespearean English. I'm sure most of us tried learning this while in school and had a hard time getting it correct. You can now convert plain English to Shakespearean using this app!

### How does the App work?
This **Vanilla JS app** first takes input from the user in English and as soon as the user clicks on the Translate button, it shows the translated text in the output field. The App translates English text into **Shakespearean English** by using [this API](https://api.funtranslations.com/translate/shakespeare.json). To learn more, check out the App above!
